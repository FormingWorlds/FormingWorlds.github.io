# PROTEUS Framework Modules

PROTEUS is designed as a modular framework, allowing researchers to use individual components or combine them for comprehensive planetary evolution studies. Each module focuses on specific aspects of planetary physics and can be used independently or integrated with other modules.
<!-- 
## Core Modules

### Atmosphere Climate
**Purpose**: Simulates atmospheric evolution, composition changes, and escape processes

**Key Features**:
- Composition and temperature profiles
- Radiative transfer, convection, sensible heating
- Condensation and cloud formation

**Applications**:
- Controlling planetary evolution through greenhouse effect
- Comparison with observables from telescopes
- Climate evolution studies and connections to astrobiology

### Interior Dynamics
**Purpose**: Models planetary interior structure, thermal evolution, and geodynamics

**Key Features**:
- Core-mantle interactions
- Thermal evolution calculations
- Fractional crystallisation and partitioning

**Applications**:
- Planetary formation studies
- Interior structure modeling
- Geodynamic evolution

### Stellar evolution
**Purpose**: Sets the energy environment for the planet.

**Key Features**:
- Spectroscopic and bolometric evolution of the host star
- Fully self-consistent with planetary evolution
- Allows calculation of atmospheric mass-loss from photoevaporation

**Applications**:
- Permits connection with measured age of real systems
